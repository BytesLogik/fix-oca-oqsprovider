# The OpenCA Fork of OQS Provider

The OpenCA Labs is providing this fork for the OQS provider that, in addition to the "normal"
support for quantum-safe algorithms, we add support for hash-n-sign with them.

## How to use the provider

Please follow all the instructions for building and installing the provider as usual. The
provider's name is changed to 'oqsprovider-openca' to make sure it does not conflict with
existing installations.
